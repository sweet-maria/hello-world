This repository is for practicing the GitHub flow

I learned that Git is open source whereas GitHub is for profit and owned by Microsoft. I also learned that more than 87% of developers use Git, but GitHub is so easy to use it is used for more than just program development. GitHub is built off of Git and an important function it provides is version control which is keeping track of changes made to code. This is useful for individuals or teams that develop programs together, but depending on the purpose it is important to use the one that fits your needs, such as being able to see when someone is making changes to code at the same time.
